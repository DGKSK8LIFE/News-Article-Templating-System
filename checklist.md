# Checklist

## Completed tasks

1. Template creator (with basic interface; to be improved) correctly writes information to the database.
2. Prototype user interface works.
3. Templates, once created, have established routes with this form: /id/title.
4. `setup.sql` script for users who want to clone and run the working app with its database
5. Removed bugs allowing the serving of non-existent routes (ie: requested article doesn't exist -> now gives 404 instead of serving it)
6. Improved documentation and organization

## TODO

1. Fix all bugs that linger in completed tasks (IE: Github issues)
 - Implement working search engine
 - Implement working template preview hyperlinks
2. Attain eventual goals (contained in README).
